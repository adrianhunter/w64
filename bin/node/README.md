Run Node.js inside the browser. Nodepod provides a virtual filesystem, shell,
npm packages, worker-backed processes, and Node-compatible HTTP servers without
requiring an application backend.

```bash
npm install @r1ck404/nodepod
```

> Nodepod used to be published as `@scelar/nodepod`. That name is deprecated;
> switch to `@r1ck404/nodepod` (same API and subpaths:
> `@r1ck404/nodepod/headless`, `/server`, `/vite`, `/next`).

Nodepod is source-available under the MIT License with the Commons Clause. See
[License](#license) before using it in a product.

## Quick start

```ts
import { Nodepod } from '@r1ck404/nodepod';

const nodepod = await Nodepod.boot({
  files: {
    '/home/project/hello.js': 'console.log("Hello from the browser!")',
  },
  workdir: '/home/project',
});

const process = await nodepod.spawn('node', ['hello.js']);
process.on('output', (text) => console.log(text));
await process.completion;

await nodepod.teardown();
```

The browser entry enables Nodepod's preview service worker by default. If your
product only needs files, processes, packages, or programmatic HTTP calls, use
the reduced mode:

```ts
const nodepod = await Nodepod.boot({ serviceWorker: false });
```

## Capabilities

- **Filesystem** — POSIX-style paths, files, directories, metadata, watchers,
  and serializable snapshots.
- **Shell and terminal** — a persistent shell with an optional xterm.js UI.
- **npm packages** — registry resolution, archive extraction, module transforms,
  and browser-side caching.
- **Processes** — Node.js scripts and shell commands executed in Web Workers.
- **HTTP servers** — Node-compatible virtual servers reached through
  `request()`, a service-worker preview, or headless loopback ingress.
- **Headless mode** — the core runtime without terminal or preview UI in the
  browser, Node.js, and Bun.
- **Profiling and inspection** — opt-in runtime traces and attached-preview
  diagnostics.

## Framework setup

Vite can serve and emit Nodepod's runtime assets automatically:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import nodepod from '@r1ck404/nodepod/vite';

export default defineConfig({ plugins: [nodepod()] });
```

Next.js, Fetch-style frameworks, Express, Fastify, bare Node servers, and static
hosts have dedicated helpers or copy-based setup. The documentation covers the
service-worker scope, preview bridge, production wildcard origins, and required
headers.

## Browser compatibility

Nodepod targets current evergreen browsers with WebAssembly and Web Workers.
Full synchronous and threaded behaviour requires cross-origin isolation and
`SharedArrayBuffer`.

Without shared memory, Nodepod supports a reduced execution path, but synchronous
child-process APIs and threaded WASI packages are unavailable. A package can also
depend on native add-ons or operating-system behaviour that browsers cannot
provide. Test the exact dependency and browser matrix your product promises.

Nodepod is not a hardened sandbox. Products that run adversarial code must define
their own trust boundary, resource limits, network policy, and cleanup strategy.

The documentation website is maintained in the private `website/` workspace in
this repository. It is live at [r1ck404.github.io/Nodepod](https://r1ck404.github.io/Nodepod/).
GitHub Pages deployment is currently manual, so updates are published after
review.

## Development

Nodepod uses pnpm 10.34.5. The runtime build and tests use Node.js 20; the docs
workspace requires Node.js 22.12 or newer.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run type-check
pnpm run build:publish
pnpm test
```

Build the documentation locally:

```bash
pnpm run docs:build
pnpm run docs:check
pnpm run docs:test
```
